# HOW THE WIRE WORKS: AUTHORITY EXPLAINER
**Official Internal Platform Position**

### MISSION
The Wire is not a listing site. It is a real-time UK rave intelligence network. Our goal is the delivery of high-fidelity, verified event signals before they reach the commercial mass market.

### DISCIPLINE 01: PROVENANCE
No alert exists without an anchor. We do not "hallucinate" events. Every intercept is tied to a specific Source ID from a Tier-A provider (Ticketmaster, Skiddle, RA).

### DISCIPLINE 02: THE SUPPORTER FIRST SHIELD
We respect the street team. Every high-fidelity signal is broadcast to the **Supporter Tier** at T-0. Public disclosure follows only after a 90-second validation window.

### DISCIPLINE 03: REGIONAL AUTONOMY
A signal in London does not bleed into Manchester. Lanes are discrete, genre-locked, and city-specific.
